Figure 1: "Screenshot of the Spreadsheet Data Extractor. The interface has two panes. On the left, a navigation panel lists one imported workbook with a single visible worksheet entry “12421-05”. On the right, the main pane shows a rendered preview of that sheet, titled “Supply of Nursing Staff (Trend Variant) in Germany up to 2049, in 1000”. The header includes “Age from … to under … Years” and “Year” with columns for 2024-2049; the first row “Total” shows values 1673, 1710, 1738, 1790, 1839, and 1867. Below the table, a row of sheet tabs (12421-01 … 12421-05) indicates that “12421-05” is selected. A status bar at the bottom displays a timestamp and the workbook path."

Figure 1: "Screenshot of the SDE while selecting first-column metadata. The left pane shows a hierarchical selection list with entries such as “B3 Nursing Staff”, “A6 Total”, the range “A6:A17 Total, 15--20, 20--25”, and “B5 2024” and “B6:B17 1673, 53, 154, …”, each with link, lock, and delete controls. The right pane renders the worksheet “Supply of Nursing Staff (Trend Variant) in Germany up to 2049, in 1000” with coloured outlines around the first column: header “Nursing Staff” and row labels “Total”, “15--20”, “20--25”; the year “2024” is highlighted in the first data column. At the bottom, a preview table lists extracted records including the sheet “12421-05”, column “Nursing Staff”, row labels, cell addresses B6/B7/B8, and values 1673, 53, and 154. The figure illustrates how first-column labels are selected and bound to the output."

Figure 2: "Screenshot of the SDE selection pane with a context menu opened for the node “B5 2024”. The left panel shows the hierarchy (e.g., “B3 Nursing Staff,” → “A6 Total,” → “A6:A17 …” → “B5 2024,” → “B6:B17 1673, 53, 154, …”). On the right, a floating menu lists actions: “encapsulate”, “enter value manually”, “move and duplicate” (highlighted), “copy cell selection”, “copy task”, and “duplicate task”. At the bottom, preview rows display timestamps, the workbook name, the sheet “12421-05”, the column label “Nursing Staff”, row labels, cell addresses, and values. The figure illustrates invoking the “move and duplicate” command on the 2024 column node."

Figure 3: "Screenshot while using the “move and duplicate” feature. A toolbar at the top shows arrow buttons, confirm/cancel, and a counter “repeat 5”. In the sheet view, the header cells “Nursing Staff” and “Year” are locked (padlock icons). The column “2024” is highlighted; five adjacent year columns to the right (2029-2049) are outlined in dark red with a pink overlay, indicating the duplicated steps. The figure illustrates shifting the selection one cell to the right and repeating it five times to replicate the column selection across the neighbouring years."

Figure 4: "Screenshot of SDE after applying “move and duplicate” and confirming (Accept). The left pane shows the hierarchical selection list (e.g., “B3 Nursing Staff”, “A6 Total”, the range “A6:A17 …”, “B5 2024”, and “B6:B17 1673, 53, 154, …”). The right pane renders the worksheet “Supply of Nursing Staff …” with the header “Nursing Staff” highlighted and six year columns 2024-2049 boxed in distinct colours, indicating the replicated column selections across years. At the bottom, the preview table lists extracted records for sheet “12421-05” with column “Nursing Staff”, row labels (Total, 15-20, 20-25), cell addresses (B6, B7, B8), and values (1673, 53, 154). A green check button in the lower right confirms the operation."

Figure 5: "Screenshot of SDE after duplicating the first table's selection to all subtables. A top toolbar shows “move and duplicate” with the counter set to “repeat 2”. In the worksheet view, six year columns (2024, 2029, 2034, 2039, 2044, 2049) are outlined in distinct colours. The cells in the top table are overlaid with lighter, less-saturated tints indicating the origin selections; the corresponding cells in the lower subtables are overlaid with stronger, more-saturated tints indicating the duplicated (destination) selections. Header cells display padlock icons for locked ranges. Row labels such as “Total”, “Male”, and “Female” with age bands (e.g., 15-20, 20-25, …) are visible, and every cell within the highlighted columns is selected across subtables. The figure demonstrates how duplicating the first table's hierarchy propagates the selection to subsequent tables, with saturation differentiating origin and destination."

Figure 6: "Diagram of the selection hierarchy before path-wise broadcasting. From left to right, rectangular nodes show the current chain of selections: “Nursing Staff” → “Total” → a stacked block with “Total”, “15-20”, and “20-25”. From that block the flow splits into three separate year nodes—“2024”, “2029”, and “2034”—each pointing to its corresponding three data cells on the right (e.g., for 2024 the values 1673, 154, 53; for 2029 the values 1710, 55, 152; for 2034 the values 1738, 59, 155). Colours match the worksheet highlights; black arrows indicate the direction of propagation. The figure illustrates the structure prior to broadcasting the selection along all paths."

Figure 7: "Diagram of the selection hierarchy after path-wise broadcasting. Each output cell now has its full upstream context replicated on its own row. From left to right, the blocks “Nursing Staff” and “Total” are repeated three times vertically, followed by a stacked block “Total / 15-20 / 20-25”, also repeated. Each row then carries one year node—2024, 2029, or 2034—aligned with the corresponding value on the far right (e.g., 1673, 154, 53 for 2024; 1710, 55, 152 for 2029; 1738, 59, 155 for 2034). Colours match the worksheet highlights and black arrows indicate the flow. The figure shows that broadcasting duplicates and aligns upstream labels so that every value cell is paired with its context, yielding one record per cell."

Figure 8: "Collage of two XML excerpts with arrows showing how worksheet cells reference central style definitions. The upper panel shows parts of “xl/styles.xml”: a “fonts” list, a “fills” list (including a solid fill with colour FFD7E1F0), a “borders” list (thin border with theme colours), and a “cellXfs” section containing an “<xf>” record with “fontId="2"”, “fillId="2"”, “borderId="1"”, and “alignment” set to centre with wrap. Arrows link these lists to the “<xf>” that combines them. A further arrow points to the lower panel from “xl/worksheets/sheetX.xml”, which shows a row “r="3"” and a cell “B3” with “s="10"” (style index) and a string value. The figure conveys that worksheet cells use a numeric style index (“s”) to select a composed style (“xf”) defined in “styles.xml”, which in turn references specific font, fill, and border entries by ID."

Figure 9: "Horizontal box plot with three rows labelled Spreadsheet Data Extractor, Microsoft Excel, and Dart Excel package. The x-axis is time in seconds on a logarithmic scale. SDE is near 0.6-1.1s, Excel around 44-51s, Dart around 340s for its single run."

Figure 9: "Grouped horizontal box plot with six rows: for each of SDE, Microsoft Excel, and a Dart Excel package, the first box shows time to parse the first rows and the second box shows time to parse the last row. SDE first-rows median ~1.23s vs. Excel ~52.76s; SDE last-row median ~5.52s vs. Excel ~52.23s."
