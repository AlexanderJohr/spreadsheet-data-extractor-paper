# User-Centred Latency Visualisation: Opening a Selected Worksheet

This directory contains a plotting script used to **visualise measured runtimes for opening a single worksheet from a large Excel workbook**.  
The script does **not** execute benchmarks itself; instead, it reads pre-recorded runtime measurements from CSV files and produces a publication-ready boxplot.

## Script

- `generate_boxplot_run_times_to_open_worksheet_from_large_workbook.py`  
  Reads runtime measurements from CSV files and generates a horizontal boxplot
  comparing worksheet opening times across different programmes.

## Input Data

The script expects three CSV files, each containing a column named `Time (seconds)`.

The CSV files are located in the following subdirectories relative to this folder:

- `parse_large_file_sde/run_times_to_open_worksheet_sde.csv`  
- `parse_large_file_microsoft_excel/run_times_to_open_worksheet_powershell.csv`  
- `parse_large_file_excel_package/run_times_to_open_worksheet_dart.csv`

Each CSV represents repeated measurements of the time required to open a
*single, user-selected worksheet* from a large workbook.

## Visualisation Details

- A **horizontal boxplot** is generated for direct comparison.
- The x-axis uses a **logarithmic scale (base 10)** to accommodate several orders
  of magnitude in runtime differences.
- Zero values are replaced by a small positive constant to allow plotting on a
  log scale.
- Major and minor tick marks are explicitly configured and labelled in seconds.
- Grid lines are shown for both major and minor ticks to improve readability.

## Output

The script produces a publication-ready [PDF Chart](generate_boxplot_run_times_to_open_large_sheet.pdf).

This figure is included directly in the paper to illustrate user-centred latency
when opening a selected worksheet from a large real-world Excel workbook.

## Re-running Measurements

This script **does not re-run performance measurements**.

To regenerate the CSV input data, the corresponding benchmark scripts must be
executed in their respective directories:

- **Dart Excel package benchmark**  
  `parse_large_file_excel_package/parse_large_file_excel_package_test.dart`  
  → writes `run_times_to_open_worksheet_dart.csv`

- **Microsoft Excel (PowerShell/COM) benchmark**  
  `parse_large_file_microsoft_excel/parse_large_file_microsoft_excel_powershell.ps1`  
  → writes `run_times_to_open_worksheet_powershell.csv`

- **Spreadsheet Data Extractor (SDE) benchmark**  
  `parse_large_file_sde/parse_large_file_sde_test.dart`  
  → writes `run_times_to_open_worksheet_sde.csv`

After re-running these benchmark scripts, the boxplot can be regenerated by
executing the Python visualisation script in this directory.

## Intended Use

This script is part of the artifact accompanying the paper and is intended for
**result reproduction and inspection**, not for benchmark execution. Runtime
measurements are obtained separately and provided to the script as CSV input.
